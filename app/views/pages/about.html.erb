  <div class="col-md-7"></br> <h4> Trainer.io: Bringing Technology to Fitness</h4>	<p>Our mission is simple: We want to use technology to make fitness more accessible.</p>
	<p>We spend tons of money every year on gym memberships, boot camps, and the latests exercise equipment. But what we're missing is the knowledge to put it all to use in a way that will get us the best results. We think everyone should have access to this knowledge and that why we created Trainer.io. </p>
	<p>We want to find the best minds in physical fitness and use our platform to allow them to effeciently and effectively provide you with the information you need. Whether you want to lose a few pounds, perform better on the basketball court, or build the best you---you'll find the support you need at TrainerIO.</p>
